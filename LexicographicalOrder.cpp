/*approach
  to implement this in constant space we start with 1 and iteratively calculate the 
  next children elements by the similarity The "children" of a number x are x * 10,
  x * 10 + 1, ..., x * 10 + 9 as long as they are â‰¤ n. After finishing possibility at 1
  we move to 2 and till n and finally return the answer*/
